# Small C Projects
Welcome to my Small C Projects repository! This collection documents my journey in learning C programming and aims to help beginners who are just starting out.

**NOTE**: Unfortunately, I’ve lost many of my earlier C projects (50+), but I will continue adding new projects to grow this repository.

## Projects
In this repository, you'll find a variety of small C programs that cover different topics such as:

- Algorithms
- Data structures
- System programming
- Problem-solving exercises
- Each project includes a brief description and the source code. Feel free to explore and learn!

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you want to help improve this repository or add more projects, please follow these steps:

- Fork the repository
- Create a new branch for your feature or fix
- Make your changes
- Submit a pull request with a description of your changes
- I’d especially appreciate contributions from others who are also learning C or have experience with the language.
